# Signal Transforms


Different signal transforms serve various purposes in signal processing, each offering unique advantages for specific applications. These transforms enable engineers and scientists to:
* Analyze signals from different perspectives (time, frequency, or time-frequency domains)
* Simplify complex mathematical operations
* Design and implement various filters
* Compress data
* Remove noise from signals
* Perform feature extraction
